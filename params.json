I received a Master Degree in Mathematics from the University of Genova (Italy) in May 2012, \r\nand a Ph.D., in Computer Science, at the same university in 2016.\r\nMy advisors, both from the University of Genova, have been Professor Leila De Floriani, Full Professor from the Department of Computer Science and Professor Maria Evelina Rossi, Full Professor of Geometry from the Department of Mathematics.\r\n\r\nMy interests are in various topics in Algebraic Topology, Computational Geometry and Commutative Algebra. Specifically, I focus my studies on topological data analysis. The aim is to develop data structures and algorithms for extracting topological information from very large data sets, such as point data and network data, for applications to scientific data analysis. This has been possible by investigating and exploiting different tools, such as simplicial and persistent homology, discrete Morse theory and multi-resolution models.",
