Piecewise-linear (PL) Morse theory and discrete Morse theory are used in shape analysis tasks to investigate the topological features of discretized spaces. In spite of their common origin in smooth Morse theory, various notions of critical points have been given in the literature for the discrete setting, making a clear understanding of the relationships occurring between them not obvious. This paper aims at providing equivalence results about critical points of the two discretized Morse theories. First of all, we prove the equivalence of the existing notions of PL critical points. Next, under an optimality condition called relative perfectness, we show a dimension agnostic correspondence between the set of PL critical points and that of discrete critical simplices of the combinatorial approach. Finally, we show how a relatively perfect discrete gradient vector field can be algorithmically built up to dimension 3. This way, we guarantee a formal and operative connection between critical sets in the PL and discrete theories.
